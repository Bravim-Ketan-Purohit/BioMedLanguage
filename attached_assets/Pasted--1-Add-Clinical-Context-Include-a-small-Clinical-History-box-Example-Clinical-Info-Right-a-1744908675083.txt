🧠 1. Add Clinical Context
Include a small "Clinical History" box.

Example:

Clinical Info: Right arm weakness and difficulty writing for 4–5 months.

👉 This quickly gives context to the report.

🛠️ 2. Detail Imaging Techniques
Create a section for Imaging Techniques Used.

Example:

Techniques:

Sagittal/axial T1

Axial FLAIR

Axial Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)

T2-weighted imaging

Gadolinium contrast-enhanced imaging

👉 Shows thoroughness and technical basis for findings.

📊 3. Highlight Size of the Lesions
Add a "Lesion Details" table:

Mass Size: 5.8 x 5.8 x 4.2 cm (main mass)

Secondary Mass: 1.3 x 0.6 cm (right temporal)

👉 Specific dimensions help clinicians quickly understand the severity.

🧬 4. Mention Contrast Usage
Quick note:

Contrast: 16 cc MultiHance given, no complications.

👉 Important because contrast-enhanced images change interpretation.

🧠 5. Summarize Vascular and Brain Findings
Quick bullets:

No acute infarct

No intracranial hemorrhage

Developmental venous anomaly (left parietal lobe)

👉 Vascular and other non-tumor findings are often very important.

📈 6. Expand on Differential Diagnoses
Instead of just "Potential Conditions," maybe organize as:

Primary suspicion: Atypical Meningioma

Other possibilities: Hemangiopericytoma, metastasis, lymphoma, solitary fibrous tumor

👉 More structured differential diagnosis looks more professional.

🎨 7. Visuals / Diagrams
Add a brain diagram marking where the masses are (posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes).

Even a simple labeled sketch would make the infographic pop!

👉 Would you like me to generate a basic brain diagram showing this? 🎯

🛡️ 8. Risk or Management Note
At the bottom, a general note like:

Next Step: Further management typically includes neurosurgical consultation, biopsy consideration, or follow-up imaging.

👉 Adds value for medical or non-medical readers.

🌟 Bonus Polishing Tips:
Use uniform colors for each section for a cleaner look.

Maybe a mini "Glossary" for technical terms like “extra-axial” and “dural tail” if the audience isn't purely medical.

Short quote of the most critical finding inside a highlighted box:

“Large bilobed extra-axial mass encasing superior sagittal sinus.”
